## ‚è≥ Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Backend Testing

- [ ] Start the server (`npm run dev`)
- [ ] Test file upload endpoint
  ```bash
  POST /api/files/upload
  ```
- [ ] Test file listing
  ```bash
  GET /api/files/list
  ```
- [ ] Test soft delete
  ```bash
  DELETE /api/files/:fileId
  ```
- [ ] Test trash listing
  ```bash
  GET /api/trash
  ```
- [ ] Test restore
  ```bash
  POST /api/trash/restore/:fileId
  ```
- [ ] Test folder operations
  ```bash
  POST /api/folders
  POST /api/folders/move
  ```
- [ ] Test public share creation
  ```bash
  POST /api/shares/:fileId/public
  ```
- [ ] Test public download (no auth)
  ```bash
  POST /api/public/download
  ```
- [ ] Test direct user sharing
  ```bash
  POST /api/shares/:fileId/user
  ```
- [ ] Test class sharing
  ```bash
  POST /api/shares/:fileId/class
  ```

### 2. Database Updates

- [ ] Verify indexes exist (especially `isDeleted`)
  ```bash
  db.files.getIndexes()
  ```
- [ ] Add index if missing
  ```bash
  db.files.createIndex({ isDeleted: 1 })
  ```
- [ ] Optionally: Mark existing files as not deleted
  ```bash
  db.files.updateMany(
    { isDeleted: { $exists: false } },
    { $set: { isDeleted: false, deletedAt: null, deletedBy: null } }
  )
  ```

### 3. Setup Trash Cleanup Job

Add to your server.js or scheduler:

```javascript
import cron from 'node-cron';
import { cleanExpiredTrashService } from './src/api/trash/services/trash.service.js';

// Run daily at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  try {
    const result = await cleanExpiredTrashService(30); // 30 days retention
    console.log(`[CRON] Trash cleanup: ${result.purgedCount} items deleted`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[CRON] Trash cleanup failed:', error);
  }
});
```

### 4. Update Other File Queries

Search and update all File.find() queries to exclude deleted files:

- [ ] Check admin routes (`src/api/admin/`)
- [ ] Check college routes (`src/api/college/`)
- [ ] Check any report generation code
- [ ] Check search functionality
- [ ] Add `isDeleted: false` to all relevant queries

Example locations to check:
```bash
grep -r "File.find" src/api/admin/
grep -r "File.find" src/api/college/
grep -r "File.find" src/api/tasks/
```

  - Permanently delete files
  - Share files
  - Access public shares

## üîç Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic File Operations
1. Upload a file
2. Verify it appears in file list
3. Download the file
4. Delete the file (soft)
5. Verify it appears in trash
6. Verify it does NOT appear in file list
7. Restore the file
8. Verify it's back in file list
9. Delete again
10. Permanently delete from trash
11. Verify it's gone from trash

### Scenario 2: Folder Operations
1. Create a folder
2. Upload files into the folder
3. Create a subfolder
4. Move files between folders
5. Delete the parent folder
6. Verify all descendants are in trash
7. Restore the parent folder
8. Verify all descendants are restored

### Scenario 3: Sharing Workflow
1. Upload a file
2. Create a public share link (1-day duration)
3. Test downloading with share code (no auth)
4. Share file with specific user
5. Share file with class
6. Delete the file (soft)
7. Verify public share is deactivated
8. Restore the file
9. Verify public share remains deactivated (security)
10. Revoke all shares
11. Permanently delete the file
12. Verify all shares are deleted

### Scenario 4: Bulk Operations
1. Upload 10 files
2. Bulk delete 5 files

- Add permission levels (view, download, edit)
- Add share analytics
- Add email notifications
- Add password-protected shares
- Add custom retention periods per user
- Add trash size quotas
