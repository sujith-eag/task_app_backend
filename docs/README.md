## Reading Order for New Developers

### Day 1: Understanding the Project
1. Read `overview.md` - Understand the project
2. Scan `shared_patterns.md` - Current architecture
3. Read `phase_0_architecture.md` - Target architecture

### Day 2: Foundation Review
1. Read `FOUNDATION_COMPLETE.md` - What's been done
2. Browse `FILE_INDEX.md` - See all files
3. Explore `src/api/_common/README.md` - Middleware docs
4. Explore `src/services/s3/README.md` - S3 service docs

### Day 3: Ready to Code
1. Read `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - How to migrate
2. Keep `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` open - For patterns
3. Check `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md` - Choose domain
4. Start refactoring!

## Reading Order for Domain Refactoring

Before starting a domain:
1. ✅ Check `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md` - Is it pending?
2. 📖 Read domain section in `phase_0_architecture.md`
3. 📝 Review `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Workflow section
4. 🔧 Open `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` - For patterns

While refactoring:
1. 🔍 Reference `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` for patterns
2. 📚 Check `_common/README.md` for middleware
3. 🔧 Check `s3/README.md` for S3 operations
4. ❓ Check `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` troubleshooting

After refactoring:
1. ✅ Update `REFACTORING_PROGRESS.md`
2. 📝 Create domain README.md
3. 🧪 Test thoroughly

## Contributing to Docs

When adding/updating documentation:

1. **Be Specific** - Include code examples
2. **Be Complete** - Cover common use cases
3. **Be Clear** - Use simple language
4. **Be Consistent** - Follow existing patterns
5. **Update Index** - Update this README if adding new docs

### Documentation Principles

- ✅ **Examples over explanation** - Show, don't just tell
- ✅ **Context matters** - Explain why, not just how
- ✅ **Keep it DRY** - Reference other docs instead of duplicating
- ✅ **Update as you go** - Don't wait until "done"
- ✅ **Think of future you** - Write for someone who doesn't remember
