<!-- Cleaned and de-duplicated README for the Shares domain -->

# Shares — implementation notes

This README summarizes the actual shares implementation in this repository and provides quick verification tips and pointers to the relevant files.

Last updated: 2025-11-03

Quick summary
- Public (code-based) shares live on the `File` document under the `publicShare` subdocument.
- Direct user shares are small mapping documents in `FileShare` (`src/models/fileshareModel.js`) and are indexed on `{ fileId, userId }`.
- The `src/api/shares` folder contains routes, controllers, validators, policies, and a service that implement share creation, revocation, and queries.

Where to look
- Models: `src/models/fileModel.js`, `src/models/fileshareModel.js`
- Service: `src/api/shares/services/shares.service.js`
- Controllers: `src/api/shares/controllers/*.js` (`shares.controller.js`, `public.controller.js`)
- Routes: `src/api/shares/routes/*.js` (`shares.routes.js`, `public.routes.js`)
- Policies and validators: `src/api/shares/policies/shares.policies.js`, `src/api/shares/validators/shares.validators.js`

Core concepts
- Public shares: single public link per file stored on the `File.publicShare` subdoc. Fields typically include `code`, `isActive`, `expiresAt`, and `lastAccessedAt`.
- Direct shares: `FileShare` documents mapping `fileId` ↔ `userId` with optional `expiresAt`. Unique compound index `{ fileId: 1, userId: 1 }` prevents duplicates.

Key API endpoints (check the route files for exact parameter names/responses)
- POST  /api/shares/:fileId/public    — create/update public share (owner only)
- DELETE /api/shares/:fileId/public    — revoke public share (owner only)
- POST  /api/public/download          — exchange `{ code }` for download URL (no auth)
- POST  /api/shares/:fileId/user      — share file with a user (creates `FileShare` document)
- DELETE /api/shares/:fileId/user     — remove user access (owner or self)
- GET   /api/shares/:fileId           — list shares for a file (owner/authorized)
- GET   /api/shares/shared-with-me    — list files shared with current user

Behavior notes & assumptions
- Public-share metadata lives on `File`; `FileShare` does not store public-share entries.
- Files in trash cannot be shared (policy `canShareFile`). Deleting a file should cascade-delete related `FileShare` docs.
- Public downloads intentionally do not require authentication; the service validates the code, active flag, and expiry.

Quick verification (no DB required)
- Check service import:  node -e "import('./src/api/shares/services/shares.service.js').then(()=>console.log('SHARES SERVICE OK')).catch(e=>{ console.error(e && e.message || e); process.exit(1) })"
- To run the app you need runtime env vars (MONGO_URI, AWS creds). Importing files that touch DB without those will error.

Recommended tests / next steps
- Unit test: creating duplicate `FileShare` for same `fileId+userId` should fail due to index uniqueness.
- Integration test: create public share → POST `/api/public/download` with code → verify presigned URL and expiry blocking.
- Consider a migration (dry-run) if your DB still contains legacy `File.sharedWith` arrays: convert them to `FileShare` documents.

Maintenance notes
- Periodic cleanup job is recommended to delete expired `FileShare` entries and optional deactivation of expired `publicShare` entries.
- Keep public-share generation and revocation logic centralized in `shares.service.js`.

## Security & Authorization

### Policies (Middleware)

Located at: `src/api/shares/policies/shares.policies.js`

#### `loadFile`
- Loads file from database
- Attaches to `req.file`
- Returns 404 if not found

#### `isFileOwner`
- Checks if current user owns the file
- Required for public share revocation, class share removal

#### `canShareFile`
- Verifies user is file owner
- Ensures file is not in trash
- Required for creating shares

#### `canAccessPublicShare`
- Verifies user is file owner
- Required for managing public shares

#### `validateSharePermissions`
- Complex permission check for removing users
- Allows user to remove self from any share
- Only owner can remove other users

#### `canViewFileShares`
- Owner can always view
- Users with access can view shares

### Security Features

1. **Authentication**: All share management requires JWT token (except public download)
2. **Authorization**: Ownership and access checks prevent unauthorized operations
3. **Validation**: Joi schemas sanitize and validate all inputs
4. **Expiration**: Automatic time-based access control
5. **Deactivation**: Manual revocation capability for public shares
6. **Access Tracking**: Monitor share usage with counts and timestamps
7. **Isolation**: FileShare model prevents File model pollution

---

## Validation

Located at: `src/api/shares/validators/shares.validators.js`

### Schemas

- **createPublicShareSchema**: Duration must be '1-hour', '1-day', or '7-days'
- **publicDownloadSchema**: Code must be non-empty string
- **shareWithUserSchema**: userIdToShareWith required, optional expiresAt ISO date
- **removeUserAccessSchema**: Optional userIdToRemove (null = remove self)
- **bulkRemoveSchema**: Array of fileIds, minimum 1
- **shareWithClassSchema**: batch (2000-2100), semester (1-8), section (uppercase string), subjectId required

### Custom Validation

Model-level validation in `FileShare.pre('save')`:
- Public shares require `publicCode`, `isActive`, `expiresAt`
- Direct shares require `sharedWith` array with at least 1 user
- Class shares require all 4 classShare fields
- Unused fields are cleared based on `shareType`

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Teacher Shares Lecture Notes with Class

```javascript
// Teacher uploads file
POST /api/files_new/upload

// Teacher shares with class
POST /api/shares/:fileId/class
{
  "batch": 2024,
  "semester": 5,
  "section": "A",
  "subjectId": "cs301"
}

// Student views shared files
GET /api/shares/shared-with-me
// Response includes lecture notes if student matches batch/semester/section
```

### Example 2: Quick Public Link for External Reviewer

```javascript
// Create 1-day public link
POST /api/shares/:fileId/public
{
  "duration": "1-day"
}
// Response: { publicCode: "a3f9c82d", shareUrl: "..." }

// External user downloads (no auth)
POST /api/public/download
{
  "code": "a3f9c82d"
}
// Response: { downloadUrl: "https://s3...", fileName: "..." }

// Owner revokes after review
DELETE /api/shares/:fileId/public
```

### Example 3: Collaborate with Team Members

```javascript
// Share with first team member
POST /api/shares/:fileId/user
{
  "userIdToShareWith": "user1",
  "expiresAt": null  // Permanent access
}

// Add second team member
POST /api/shares/:fileId/user
{
  "userIdToShareWith": "user2"
}
// Both users now in sharedWith array

// Team member leaves, removes self
DELETE /api/shares/:fileId/user
{
  "userIdToRemove": null  // Remove self
}

// Owner removes another user
DELETE /api/shares/:fileId/user
{
  "userIdToRemove": "user2"
}
```

### Example 4: Student Cleans Up Shared Files

```javascript
// Student views all shared files
GET /api/shares/shared-with-me
// Response: 20 files

// Student bulk removes self from old courses
POST /api/shares/bulk-remove
{
  "fileIds": ["file1", "file2", "file3", ..., "file10"]
}
// Removed from 10 shares at once
```

## Integration Notes

### With Files Domain

- Files domain handles personal file operations (upload, download, organize)
- Shares domain handles all sharing operations
- Shared files use Files domain download endpoints with added access checks
- File model does NOT store sharing data anymore

### With Trash Domain (Future)

- Files in trash cannot be shared (checked in `canShareFile` policy)
- Deleting file should cascade delete all associated shares
- Restoring file from trash should NOT restore shares (security)

### Model Relationships

```javascript
FileShare → File (many-to-one)
FileShare → User (many-to-one for owner)
FileShare → User (many-to-many via sharedWith array)
FileShare → Subject (many-to-one for class shares)
```

### Cleanup Job

Recommended: Run periodic cleanup job to delete expired shares

```javascript
// In a cron job or scheduler
import { FileShare } from './models/fileshareModel.js';

// Daily cleanup
setInterval(async () => {
  const result = await FileShare.cleanExpired();
  console.log(`Cleaned up ${result.deletedCount} expired shares`);
}, 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);  // 24 hours
```

### Route Registration

Mount in central route registry:

```javascript
// In server.js or routes index
import sharesRoutes from './api/shares/routes/shares.routes.js';
import publicRoutes from './api/shares/routes/public.routes.js';

app.use('/api/shares', sharesRoutes);
app.use('/api/public', publicRoutes);
```

---

## Error Handling

All controllers use `asyncHandler` to catch errors. Common error responses:

- **400 Bad Request**: Validation errors, invalid share state
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid token, expired share code
- **403 Forbidden**: Insufficient permissions (not owner, not shared with user)
- **404 Not Found**: File not found, share not found, user not found
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database errors, S3 errors

Example error response:
```json
{
  "message": "Access denied: Only file owner can share files"
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Public Shares
- [ ] Create public share with all duration options
- [ ] Download using valid code
- [ ] Verify expiration blocking
- [ ] Revoke active share
- [ ] Track access count
- [ ] Update existing public share
- [ ] Invalid code returns 401

### Direct Shares
- [ ] Share with valid user
- [ ] Prevent self-sharing
- [ ] Prevent sharing with owner
- [ ] Add multiple users to same share
- [ ] User removes self
- [ ] Owner removes specific user
- [ ] Bulk remove from multiple files
- [ ] Optional expiration works

### Class Shares
- [ ] Share with valid class
- [ ] Validate subject exists
- [ ] Students see shared files
- [ ] Remove class share
- [ ] One class share per file

### Authorization
- [ ] Non-owners cannot create shares
- [ ] Non-owners cannot revoke public shares
- [ ] Users can only remove self (not others)
- [ ] Files in trash cannot be shared
- [ ] Shared users can view file shares

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Share already exists (update vs error)
- [ ] Expired shares not accessible
- [ ] Deleted files cascade delete shares
- [ ] Invalid user IDs handled gracefully
- [ ] Empty sharedWith array deletes share

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexes**: Compound indexes optimize common queries
2. **Batch Operations**: `bulkRemoveShareAccess` uses `$pull` for efficiency
3. **Minimal Populates**: Only populate needed fields in responses
4. **Access Checks**: Static method `userHasAccess` uses indexed query
5. **Cleanup Job**: Periodic deletion prevents database bloat

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Permission levels (view-only, download, edit)
- [ ] Share folders (not just individual files)
- [ ] Email notifications when file is shared
- [ ] Share analytics dashboard
- [ ] Password-protected public shares
- [ ] Custom expiration dates
- [ ] Share templates for common scenarios
- [ ] Audit log for share operations

---

## Related Documentation

- **Files Domain**: `src/api/files_new/README.md` - Personal file operations
- **File Model**: `src/models/fileModel.js` - Core file entity
- **FileShare Model**: `src/models/fileshareModel.js` - Share entity
- **Auth Middleware**: `src/middleware/auth.middleware.js` - JWT authentication
- **S3 Service**: `src/services/s3.service.js` - File storage operations

> Note: Authentication and middleware have been consolidated. The canonical auth middleware now lives at `src/api/_common/middleware/auth.middleware.js` and the system issues an httpOnly cookie named `jwt` for browser sessions. Runtime code should prefer the cookie (via `withCredentials`) — legacy `src/middleware/auth.middleware.js` is retained as a compatibility shim that re-exports the centralized implementation and emits a deprecation warning. For non-browser clients, Authorization header remains supported.
