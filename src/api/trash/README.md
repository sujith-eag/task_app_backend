- **Auto-cleanup** - Scheduled purging of old trash items
- **Admin tools** - Direct hard delete for administrators

### Key Benefits
- **Data safety** - Accidental deletions can be recovered
- **Storage management** - Old trash automatically purged
- **User experience** - Familiar trash/recycle bin pattern
- **Audit trail** - Track who deleted what and when

## Soft Delete System

### File Model Updates

The `File` model has been enhanced with soft-delete support:

```javascript
{
  // Existing fields...
  isDeleted: Boolean,        // Flag indicating file is in trash
  deletedAt: Date,           // When file was moved to trash
  deletedBy: ObjectId        // User who deleted the file
}
```

### How It Works

1. **Soft Delete**: File marked with `isDeleted: true`, not removed from database
2. **Retention Period**: Files kept in trash for configurable period (default: 30 days)
3. **Restore**: Clear `isDeleted` flag, file becomes accessible again
4. **Purge**: Permanent deletion from S3 and database after retention or manual action

### Folder Handling

When a folder is deleted/restored:
- All descendants are recursively affected
- Path-based queries ensure efficiency
- Descendant count shown in trash listings

### Share Deactivation

When files are soft-deleted:
- Public shares are automatically deactivated (`isActive: false`)
- Direct and class shares remain in database
- Shares are NOT restored when file is restored (security)
- Shares are permanently deleted when file is purged

## Security & Authorization

### Policies (Middleware)

Located at: `src/api/trash/policies/trash.policies.js`

#### `loadFile`
- Loads file from database
- Attaches to `req.file`
- Returns 404 if not found

#### `isFileOwner`
- Verifies user owns the file
- Required for all operations

#### `isInTrash`
- Ensures file is soft-deleted
- Required for restore and purge

#### `isNotInTrash`
- Ensures file is NOT deleted
- Required for soft-delete

#### `isAdmin`
- Verifies user has admin role
- Required for cleanup and hard delete

#### `validateParentForRestore`
- Checks parent folder exists
- Ensures parent is not deleted
- Required for restore operations

#### `bulkOperationLimit`
- Limits bulk operations to 100 items

### Security Features

1. **Ownership Verification**: All operations verify user owns files
2. **State Validation**: Operations check file is in correct state (deleted/not deleted)
3. **Parent Validation**: Restore checks parent folder validity
4. **Bulk Limits**: Maximum 100 items per bulk operation
5. **Admin Protection**: Sensitive operations require admin role
6. **Cascade Safety**: Share deactivation prevents deleted file access
7. **Audit Trail**: `deletedBy` field tracks who deleted files

---

## Validation

Located at: `src/api/trash/validators/trash.validators.js`

### Schemas

- **bulkOperationSchema**: Array of fileIds, minimum 1
- **cleanupSchema**: retentionDays (1-365, default 30)
- **fileIdParamSchema**: Single fileId parameter validation

### Model-Level Validation

- `isDeleted` defaults to `false`
- `deletedAt` and `deletedBy` default to `null`
- All three fields updated atomically during soft-delete

---

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: User Accidentally Deletes File

```javascript
// User deletes file
DELETE /api/trash/soft-delete/:fileId
// File moved to trash, not permanently deleted

// User realizes mistake, restores file
POST /api/trash/restore/:fileId
// File restored to original location

// User can access file again
GET /api/files_new/list
// File appears in normal listing
```

### Example 2: Clean Up Old Projects

```javascript
// User selects multiple old project files
POST /api/trash/soft-delete/bulk
{
  "fileIds": ["file1", "file2", "folder1", ...]
}
// All items moved to trash

// After 30 days, automatic cleanup runs
POST /api/trash/cleanup
{
  "retentionDays": 30
}
// Old items permanently deleted from S3 and DB
```

### Example 3: Empty Trash to Free Storage

```javascript
// User views trash statistics
GET /api/trash/stats
// Response: 2.5GB in trash

// User empties entire trash
DELETE /api/trash/empty
// All trash items permanently deleted

// Storage quota freed
GET /api/trash/stats
// Response: 0 bytes in trash
```

### Example 4: Admin Emergency Deletion

```javascript
// Admin needs to immediately remove sensitive file
DELETE /api/trash/admin/hard-delete/:fileId
// File bypasses trash, immediately removed from S3 and DB

// No recovery possible
// Audit log shows admin action
```

### Example 5: Folder Hierarchy Handling

```javascript
// User deletes folder with 50 files
DELETE /api/trash/soft-delete/folderId
// Response: "Folder and 51 items moved to trash"

// User restores folder
POST /api/trash/restore/folderId
// Response: "Folder and 51 items restored"

// All descendants automatically handled
```

---

## Retention & Cleanup

### Default Retention Policy

- **Retention Period**: 30 days (configurable)
- **Auto-Cleanup**: Scheduled job purges expired items
- **Manual Cleanup**: Admins can trigger cleanup with custom retention

### Cleanup Job Setup

Add to your scheduler (e.g., node-cron):

```javascript
import cron from 'node-cron';
import { cleanExpiredTrashService } from './api/trash/services/trash.service.js';

// Run daily at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  try {
    const result = await cleanExpiredTrashService(30);
    console.log(`Trash cleanup: ${result.purgedCount} items deleted`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Trash cleanup failed:', error);
  }
});
```

### Storage Management

```javascript
// Calculate trash storage impact
GET /api/trash/stats
// Shows total MB in trash

// If storage quota is tight, empty trash
DELETE /api/trash/empty
// Immediate storage recovery
```

### Retention Recommendations

- **Personal Files**: 30 days
- **Academic Materials**: 90 days
- **Admin/System Files**: 7 days (immediate review)
- **Large Files**: Consider shorter retention

---

## Integration Notes

### With Files Domain

Files domain now uses trash service instead of hard delete:

```javascript
// OLD (hard delete)
await File.findByIdAndDelete(fileId);
await deleteFromS3(s3Key);

// NEW (soft delete)
import { softDeleteFileService } from '../trash/services/trash.service.js';
await softDeleteFileService(fileId, userId);
```

### With Shares Domain

- Soft-delete automatically deactivates public shares
- Direct and class shares remain but file is inaccessible
- Purge permanently deletes all FileShare documents
- Restore does NOT reactivate shares (security feature)

### Query Modifications

All file queries should exclude deleted files:

```javascript
// Always filter out deleted files
const files = await File.find({
  user: userId,
  isDeleted: false  // ← Important!
});

// Or use a default scope (Mongoose plugin)
fileSchema.plugin(softDeletePlugin);
```

### Index Optimization

The `isDeleted` field is indexed for performance:

```javascript
// In File model
{
  isDeleted: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false,
    index: true  // ← Efficient queries
  }
}
```

### Route Registration

Mount in central route registry:

```javascript
// In server.js or routes index
import trashRoutes from './api/trash/routes/trash.routes.js';

app.use('/api/trash', trashRoutes);
```

### Migration Considerations

If upgrading from hard-delete to soft-delete:

1. Add new fields to File model
2. Update all delete operations to use trash service
3. Add `isDeleted: false` filter to existing queries
4. Set up cleanup job
5. Inform users about new trash functionality

---

## Error Handling

All controllers use `asyncHandler` to catch errors. Common error responses:

### 400 Bad Request
- File is already in trash
- File is not in trash
- Parent folder is deleted/missing
- Invalid retention days
- Bulk operation exceeds limit

### 403 Forbidden
- User is not file owner
- User is not admin (for admin operations)
- Permission to delete multiple files denied

### 404 Not Found
- File not found

### 500 Internal Server Error
- S3 deletion failed
- Database operation failed

Example error response:
```json
{
  "message": "Cannot restore: Parent folder is deleted. Restore parent first."
}
```

## Testing Checklist

### Soft Delete
- [ ] Soft delete single file
- [ ] Soft delete folder with descendants
- [ ] Bulk soft delete
- [ ] Verify shares deactivated
- [ ] Verify ownership check
- [ ] Cannot delete already deleted file

### Restore
- [ ] Restore single file
- [ ] Restore folder with descendants
- [ ] Bulk restore
- [ ] Parent folder validation
- [ ] Skip files with deleted parents
- [ ] Cannot restore non-deleted file

### Purge
- [ ] Purge single file from trash
- [ ] Purge folder with descendants
- [ ] Bulk purge
- [ ] Empty entire trash
- [ ] Verify S3 deletion
- [ ] Verify share deletion
- [ ] Cannot purge non-deleted file

### Admin Operations
- [ ] Admin hard delete
- [ ] Cleanup with various retention days
- [ ] Non-admin blocked from admin operations

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Delete → Restore → Delete again
- [ ] Restore to deleted parent fails
- [ ] Bulk operation limit enforcement
- [ ] Empty trash when already empty
- [ ] Folder descendant count accuracy
- [ ] Concurrent operations handling

### Performance
- [ ] Large folder deletion (1000+ files)
- [ ] Bulk operations (100 items)
- [ ] Path-based queries efficient
- [ ] S3 deletion parallelization

---

## Performance Considerations

1. **Path-Based Queries**: Regex on indexed `path` field for efficient hierarchy operations
2. **Bulk S3 Deletion**: Parallel `Promise.all()` for multiple S3 keys
3. **Atomic Operations**: `updateMany()` for bulk soft-delete/restore
4. **Index Usage**: `isDeleted` index speeds up trash queries
5. **Batch Limits**: 100-item limit prevents timeout issues
6. **Lazy Descendant Counts**: Only calculated when listing trash

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Trash size quotas (limit trash storage)
- [ ] Scheduled auto-purge per user preferences
- [ ] Trash search and filtering
- [ ] Restore to different location
- [ ] Version history for purged files
- [ ] Bulk operations progress tracking
- [ ] Email notifications for auto-purge
- [ ] Trash analytics dashboard
- [ ] Selective folder restore (restore only some descendants)
- [ ] Trash export before emptying

## Comparison: Hard Delete vs Soft Delete

| Feature | Hard Delete (Old) | Soft Delete (New) |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Recovery** | Impossible | Possible within retention period |
| **Storage** | Immediately freed | Freed after retention/manual purge |
| **User Experience** | Risky | Forgiving, familiar pattern |
| **S3 Calls** | Immediate | Delayed until purge |
| **Database** | Immediate removal | Flag-based filtering |
| **Shares** | Cascade deleted | Deactivated, then cascade deleted |
| **Admin Control** | Limited | Full control with admin tools |
| **Audit** | No trail | Full audit trail |

## Troubleshooting

### "Cannot restore: Parent folder is deleted"
**Solution**: Restore parent folder first, or manually update `parentId` to null (root)

### "File is already in trash"
**Solution**: Use restore endpoint instead, or purge if no longer needed

### "File must be in trash before permanent deletion"
**Solution**: Soft-delete first, then purge. Or use admin hard-delete (admin only)

### Large folder deletion times out
**Solution**: Break into smaller chunks, or increase server timeout for trash operations

### Cleanup job not running
**Solution**: Verify cron job is registered, check scheduler logs, ensure admin authentication
