# Admin Module - Phase 0 Architecture

## Overview

The **Admin** module is the parent module that orchestrates all administrative functions in the application. It has been refactored from a monolithic structure into a modular, domain-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns.

This module serves as a **mounting point** for five self-contained sub-domains, each handling a specific area of administrative responsibility.

## Architecture Pattern

Following the Phase 0 architecture guidelines, the admin module:

- **Delegates** to specialized sub-domains instead of containing logic itself
- **Enforces** authentication and authorization at the parent level
- **Maintains** consistent patterns across all sub-domains
- **Separates** concerns: controllers (HTTP), services (business logic), validators (input validation)

**Implementation Details**:
- Uses Joi validation for request data
- Business logic in service layer
- Async email sending (non-blocking)
- Thin controllers delegating to services

---

### 2. Management (`/api/admin/management`) ✅ **Implemented**

**Responsibility**: Comprehensive user management including promotions, teacher/student data updates.

**Access Control**: Admin only

**Key Features**:
- Query users by role (student, teacher, HOD, user)
- List all teachers with assignments
- Promote users to faculty (teacher/HOD)

- `PATCH /api/admin/management/users/:userId/promote` - Promote to faculty
- `PUT /api/admin/management/students/:studentId` - Update student details
- `PUT /api/admin/management/students/:studentId/enrollment` - Update enrollment

**Business Rules**:
- Semester change clears all enrollments
- Enrolled subjects must match student's semester

## Authorization Hierarchy

### Admin (`isAdmin` middleware)
Full access to:
- ✅ Applications
- ✅ Management
- ✅ Teacher Assignments
- ✅ Subjects
- ✅ Reports

### HOD - Head of Department (`isAdminOrHOD` middleware)
Limited access to:
- ✅ Reports (read-only analytics and statistics)

### Authentication
All routes require authentication via the `protect` middleware before any admin-specific checks.

## Design Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility
Each sub-domain handles one area of administrative functionality.

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Routes**: Define endpoints and middleware
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests/responses (thin layer)
- **Services**: Contain business logic and orchestration
- **Validators**: Validate and sanitize input

### 3. Self-Contained Modules
Each sub-domain can be understood and tested independently.

### 4. Consistent Patterns
All sub-domains follow the same architectural pattern.

### 5. Clear Boundaries
Well-defined interfaces between sub-domains prevent tight coupling.

## Migration from Old Structure

### Old Structure (Monolithic)
```
src/api/admin/
├── admin.routes.js                  # Monolithic router
├── admin.controller.js              # Large controller file
└── controllers/
    ├── applications.controller.js
    ├── assignments.controller.js
    ├── management.controller.js
    ├── reports.controller.js
    └── subjects.controller.js
```

### New Structure (Modular)
```
src/api/admin/
├── routes/
│   └── admin.routes.js              # Parent router (mounting point)
├── applications/                     # Self-contained sub-domain
├── management/                       # Self-contained sub-domain
├── teacher-assignments/              # Self-contained sub-domain
├── subjects/                         # Self-contained sub-domain
└── reports/                          # Self-contained sub-domain
```

## Benefits of This Architecture

### For Developers
- ✅ **Easier to understand**: Each sub-domain is focused and small
- ✅ **Easier to test**: Isolated units can be tested independently
- ✅ **Easier to modify**: Changes are localized to specific sub-domains
- ✅ **Easier to navigate**: Clear folder structure

### For the Application
- ✅ **Better maintainability**: Code is organized and documented
- ✅ **Better scalability**: Sub-domains can be optimized independently
- ✅ **Better security**: Authorization is enforced consistently
- ✅ **Better error handling**: Errors are contained within sub-domains

### For the Team
- ✅ **Parallel development**: Multiple developers can work on different sub-domains
- ✅ **Clear ownership**: Each sub-domain has a clear purpose
- ✅ **Onboarding**: New developers can understand one sub-domain at a time

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement each sub-domain incrementally** (applications → management → teacher-assignments → subjects → reports)
2. **Test each sub-domain** before moving to the next
3. **Update integration** once all sub-domains are complete
4. **Archive old files** after confirming stability
